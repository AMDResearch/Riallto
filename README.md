# Riallto documentation

This branch contains Jupyter Book sources and build for the Riallto documentation.

Docs are built offline on a Ryzen AI laptop. Generated html docs can be found in the ./docs folder on this branch. 

## Rebuild Docs

* Jupyterbook needs to be installed

In the Riallto environment, run build.bat in the **source** folder, and copy the contents from *_build/html* to the **./docs** folder.
