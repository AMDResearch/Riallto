# Designing for the Neural Processing Unit on AMD Ryzen AI with Open-Source Tools

## Abstract

This tutorial introduces the Neural Processing Unit (NPU) on the [AMD Ryzen™ AI](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/consumer/ryzen-ai.html) APU and provides hands-on programming experience with open-source software tools. The [AMD Ryzen™ AI](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/consumer/ryzen-ai.html) platform is the first in a new class of NPUs designed for x86 computers. The NPU is built on the [AMD XDNA™](https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/xdna.html) spatial dataflow computer architecture, and consists of a tiled array of AI Engine processors, a set of VLIW vector processors with adaptable interconnect, designed to offer lower latency and better energy efficiency.

Participants will first gain insight into the system architecture of an x86 Ryzen AI processor and the AI Engine compute and data movement capabilities through the [Riallto](https://riallto.ai/) open-source exploration framework. Riallto lets users explore the NPU architecture and its programming tools running on Jupyter notebooks. This hands-on tutorial will guide attendees through a series of vision processing examples illustrating various NPU architectural features. You will also see how to program the NPU using Riallto. Then, the IRON AIE programming guide and examples introduce the participants to writing their own compute kernel and data movement. This Interface Representation for hands-ON (IRON) is an API for close-to-metal programming of the AIE-array. It is an open-access toolkit enabling performance engineers to build fast and efficient, often specialized designs through a Python API for [MLIR-AIE](https://github.com/Xilinx/mlir-aie), AMD MLIR dialect representing the AIE-array. Finally, we will briefly show how the [AMD Ryzen™ AI Software]() allows users to seamlessly run AI inference on the [AMD Ryzen™ AI](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/consumer/ryzen-ai.html) based PC.
