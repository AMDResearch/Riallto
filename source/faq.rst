Riallto FAQ
===========

What is Riallto?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Riallto is an exploration framework for `AMD Ryzen\ TM AI
   PCs <https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/consumer/ryzen-ai.html#tabs-74833e1024-item-833270fb2a-tab>`__.
   The framework consists of a set of open-source materials designed to
   introduce users to the newly-emerging AI topics of spatial computing
   and neural processing units (NPUs). It explains the concepts and
   motivation for spatial computing and NPUs and gives users hands-on
   experience of interacting with a Ryzen AI NPU for the first time.
   Riallto helps users to develop a strong conceptual understanding of
   these exciting, new ideas and a strong intuition for how they work
   and what they are capable of.

Who is Riallto intended for?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Riallto is intended for anyone interested in AI, especially the
   newly-emerging topics of spatial computing and neural processing
   units (NPUs). The intended audience includes students, educators,
   researchers, professional engineers and hobbyists.

Is Riallto a product?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  No, Riallto is open-source software (with a few closed-source
   elements) that is developed and supported by the AMD Research and
   Advanced Development (RAD) team.

What does Riallto include?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  The Riallto framework includes videos, animations, Jupyter
   notebooks, interactive demonstrations, tutorials and hands-on coding
   examples.

Can I use Riallto to develop software applications for a Ryzen AI NPU?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Riallto is not an SDK (Software Development Kit) and it is not
   recommended for developing applications for the Ryzen AI NPU. It can
   be used, however, to create and run applets to demonstrate features
   of the NPU architecture. We provide several such examples in the
   Riallto notebooks.

   If you are interested in compiler research for the Ryzen AI
   architecture, we recommend other open-source projects from AMD RAD:

   -  `MLIR-AIE <https://github.com/Xilinx/mlir-aie>`__
   -  `MLIR-AIR <https://github.com/Xilinx/mlir-air>`__
