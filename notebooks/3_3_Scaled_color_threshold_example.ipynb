    "In the color threshold application, all the individual pixels in each of the three channels (red, green and blue) were processed individually. There are no dependencies between pixels, so each pixel can be processed independently, in any order, or even concurrently. \n",
    "\n",
    "The computation performed by the color threshold algorithm is an example of what is referred to as an [**_embarrassingly parallel algorithm_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel).  This is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> an algorithm where little or no effort is needed to separate the problem into several parallel tasks. This is often the case where there is little or no dependency or need for communication between those parallel tasks, or for results between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This typically occurs when there is minimal inter-task dependency or a negligible need for communication between parallel tasks. In simple terms, these algorithms are \"embarrassingly\" easy to parallelize, hence the name. Such algorithms are wonderful because they can be parallelized easily, thereby speeding them up significantly, with minimal effort on our part. We will use this example to show how to use *data level parallelism* on the Ryzen AI NPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve higher performance, we can divide an application across multiple computing kernels, each operating on a different portion of the frame. This division of data processing among multiple compute units is known as [*data level parallelism*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_parallelism) or coarse-grained parallelism. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will revisit the color threshold example used previously, but this time it will make use of all four compute tiles in a Ryzen AI NPU column to map independent instances of the same kernel. The input data will be evenly split across each kernel, meaning that each compute tile will process one quarter of the data in every frame.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mapping software kernels to compute tiles is usually straightforward. Efficiently managing the movement of data within the NPU can require careful planning. As the designer, you must consider the available connections and data movement resources. The sole purpose of the memory tile is to provide more advanced data movement capabilities above what the compute and interface tiles can support. \n",
    "\n",
    "Memory tiles are used where larger blocks of data need to be divided and distributed to compute tiles, where there is data reuse in different tiles in the NPU, and where data needs to be collected and recombined or reorganized in some way before it is streamed out of the array.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While the compute and interface tiles have 4 data movers, each memory tile has a total of 12 data movers for moving data to and from any other tiles. Six of these data movers are for input streams from any tiles, and six are for output streams to any tiles. This allows transfer of up to six streams of data in both directions to any tile simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data movers can also transfer data between neighboring memory tiles (to the east and west) in applications that span multiple NPU columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the data movers in the compute and interface tiles can address data in 3-dimensions, the data movers in the memory tiles can index and address memory in 4-dimensions.\n",

While transferring single pixels to each node is possible, it would be an inefficient way to move data. Therefore, we must explore and implement more optimal data movement strategies.\n",
