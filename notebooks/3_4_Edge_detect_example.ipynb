    "[Edge detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection) is a computer vision technique that identifies the boundaries or edges of objects within an image by highlighting abrupt changes in intensity or color. This notebook will use an edge detection application consisting of four kernels, each mapped to a compute tile in a column of the Ryzen AI NPU. This example will illustrate how data movement between kernels can be optimized by allowing neighboring compute tiles to share their data memories. \n",

    "The video pipeline is the same as previous examples. The NPU will use the video input from the camera, process the data and display the result in the notebook. The result will be the video stream with edges highlighted. When you run the application, you will be able to select between different filters, and a threshold value to control the edge detection effect. The input video from your camera is received in color and the output image will be in grayscale so you can easily identify the edges.\n",

    "This example could be mapped and run on the NPU in different ways. All four kernels of this application could be run sequentially on a single compute tile. The `rgb2gray` kernel receives RGB data, converts it to grayscale, and writes the grayscale data to memory. The `filter2d` kernel could then run in the same compute tile, read the grayscale data, processes it, and write its results to memory, and so on. The performance of this application with all four kernels running on a single tile would be low relative to the available compute resources in the array. \n",

    "Alternatively, each of the four kernels could be mapped to a compute tile in a single column and carry out their processing on the video stream concurrently. This is known as task level parallelism - distributing tasks across different processors in a multi-core system. It would take some time for the initial data to flow through the kernels and produce the first results, but once each kernel has data, using four compute tiles should increase the throughput of the system. This should give some immediate speed-up to the whole application as we are now using 4x the number of compute resources. However, the performance of the application would now be determined by the data movement between the kernels and if the system can supply data to the pipeline at a fast enough rate to benefit from the available compute resources.

The formerly empty buffer becomes the new write buffer and starts to accumulate data, while the previously full buffer becomes the read buffer and begins to be emptied.\n",
